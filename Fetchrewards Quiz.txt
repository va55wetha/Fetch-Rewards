What are the top 5 brands by receipts scanned for most recent month?

select  r.dateScanned, b.brandCode, r.id
from brands b
join reciepts r
ON r[rewardsReceiptItemList].pointsPayerId = b[cpg].id
orderby 2,1
limit 5

When considering average spend from receipts with 'rewardsReceiptStatus’ of ‘Accepted’ or ‘Rejected’, which is greater?

select rewardsRecieptStatus, Avg(totalSpent) as Avg_spend from reciepts
having rewardsReceiptStatus ="Accepted" or rewardsReceiptStatus = 'Rejected'
order by Avg_spend

----------------------------------------------------------
When considering total number of items purchased from receipts with 'rewardsReceiptStatus’ of ‘Accepted’ or ‘Rejected’, which is greater?

select rewardsReceiptStatus, sum(purchasedItemCount) as Total
from reciepts  
having rewardsReceiptStatus ="Accepted" or rewardsReceiptStatus = 'Rejected'
order by Total
-----------------------------------------
Which brand has the most spend among users who were created within the past 6 months?

select  u.createdDate, b.brandCode, r.totalSpend, u.userId
from brands b
join reciepts r
ON r[rewardsReceiptItemList].pointsPayerId = b[cpg].id
join users u
on userId = userId

Third: Evaluate Data Quality Issues in the Data Provided

Users Data    :Missing fields like "lastLogin" field missing for some users
Brands Ddata  :Missing fields like "categoryCode" for some brands and the fields are shuffled not in the same order, we have to rearrange them again will consume time and money
------------------------------------------------------------
Fourth: Communicate with Stakeholders
 
I found Data quality issues by Google sheets, I found some issues but still more.
